# APEX:E3 API Low Code Examples

Here you will find powerful low code examples for:

## [Python](https://github.com/apexe3/apexe3-api/tree/main/examples/python)
## [Nodejs](https://github.com/apexe3/apexe3-api/tree/main/examples/nodejs)
## [Google Sheets](https://github.com/apexe3/apexe3-api/tree/main/examples/google-sheets)  

The examples cover the following usecases for Digital Asset markets

- Streaming of a real-time global orderbook for a given pair across exchanges
- Streaming of total liquidity available for a given pair across exchanges
- Streaming of identified whale orders, arbitrageable markets, bid/ask imbalances and spreads
- On-demand programmatic screening using well known technical indicators as filters
- On-demand lookup of supported tokens, markets and exchanges
- Google Sheet insights, exchange analytics and global orderbook dashboards

All examples make use of an apexe3 wrapper that takes care of connectivity and data formatting. As a result the examples provide simplified data structures that can be manipulated, saved or analysed for any use case you desire e.g. algorithmic trading, research or custom dashboard creation.

Your APEX:E3 credentials will be needed to run all examples. (email contactus@apexe3.com to obtain credentials).
